# Monty-Hall-Simulator

Based on the original TV show Let's Make a Deal, the player's ultimate goal is to win some cash.

The cash is behind one of three doors, the other two are hiding goats. After the initial selection, one of the two remaining doors reveals a goat. The player must then choose to KEEP their original selection, or SWITCH their selection to the remaining unopned door. 

Paradoxically if the player switches their selection after one of the losing doors is opened, the odds of winning the cash double from 1/3 to 2/3. 

The math behind this problem is better explained by vox
